# VulkanMacOS
Sample Program for Vulkan on MacOS with GLFW. Cube with mouse control, animation, and textures. Code largely based on tutorial found [Here](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) and sample code from the [Vulkan class](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/vulkan/) taught at Oregon State University by Professor Mike Bailey.

Xcode project must be updated with relevant environment variable paths in scheme manager as well as library and header search paths for your local system with the Vulkan MacOS SDK. GLFW shared library might have to be built from source for your own machine to properly load the Vulkan SDK. For help in this process, reference the video mentioned below.

For help in setting up your own system a video has been made describing the setup process which can be found [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDU49h0c_y0&t=24s)

*NOTE: This code has been tested on a 15" Macbook Pro(mid 2015) and a Windows desktop with a NVIDIA GTX 760.
